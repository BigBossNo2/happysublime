        <p>When we write code, it’s very nice to be able to keep track of all of our
changes such that we can always go back to an earlier version when we mess
something up. It’s also really important to coordinate our changes with others
working on the same code. For these reasons, programmers use programs called
<em>Version Control Systems</em> to manage their code. Git is a VCS.</p>

<p>Git is the stupid content tracker, which means it tracks your data easily.</p>

won’t repeat what others already did.

<p>Fine, Let’s try to do some real work, usually when people try to talk about
git, they suppose the listener knows about systems like SVN or CVS. I don’t,
and if my reader–you knows nothing about these bullshit traditional version
control systems, it is actually a advantage. </p>

<h2 id="installing-git">Installing git</h2>

<p>On <strong>ubuntu</strong>, it is:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install git-core
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it. On other operating systems this may differ.</p>

<p>Try and See:</p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/repo-farm/LGCB/book$ git --version
git version 1.6.3.3
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are good to go.</p>

<h2 id="i-want-versions">I want versions!</h2>

<p>you have files and subdirs in a <em>common directory</em>, you have files and subdirs
in a <em>git directory</em>. What’s the difference? It is in a <em>git directory</em>, you
can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>have revision history of all files </li>
  <li>so that if you make a mistake modifying these files, you are free to go
back</li>
  <li>so it is a time machine</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, “time machine” sounds cool, but what to do to get a <em>git directory</em>?</p>

<p>now let’s do it:</p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~$ mkdir mydir
peter@vostro:~$ cd mydir/
peter@vostro:~/mydir$ ls
peter@vostro:~/mydir$ vim README
peter@vostro:~/mydir$ ls
README
peter@vostro:~/mydir$ cat README 
hello world
</code></pre>

<p>we get a <em>common directory</em> named <code>mydir</code>, and some git work</p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/mydir$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/peter/mydir/.git/
</code></pre>

<p>it is nothing difficult, just a simple command <code>git init</code>, but now you get a
<em>git directory</em> already, you see nothing until you do: </p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/mydir$ ls -a
.  ..  .git  README
</code></pre>

<p>So the difference, between a common dir and a git dir is simply this little
<code>.git</code> directory. </p>

<p><code>.git</code> is the heart of git, and it is usually called a <em>git repository</em>,
because all the history of whatever in your <code>mydir</code> is stored there.</p>

<p>My people will say now: OK, <code>mydir</code> is a time machine, I am safe and allowed
to make mistakes now, because the history is saved. Actually not yet. It is
easy for git to automatically save whatever in <code>mydir</code> and save a new revision
every time you change your stuff. Git can, but git won’t. Because that is not
what the users want. So you need to it manually.</p>

<p>First, tell git which file you want to track, by</p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/mydir$ git add README
</code></pre>

<p>so to everything other than the <code>README</code>, git will turn a blind eye.</p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/mydir$ git commit -a -m "my first version"
[master (root-commit) b50d0f7] my first version
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
  create mode 100644 README
  peter@vostro:~/mydir$ 
</code></pre>

<p>now you have the <em>r0</em> in the following graph:</p>

<center><img src="./images/rev.png" /></center>
<center>revisions</center>

<p>Surely, if you have only <em>r0</em>, that’s not the point to do version control, so
you need to make a delta, and get the <em>r1</em>, like this: </p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/mydir$ vim README 
peter@vostro:~/mydir$ cat README 
hello world
hello again
</code></pre>

<p>Now make <em>r1</em>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/mydir$ git commit -a -m "my second verion"
[master 3ccdf5e] my second verion
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
</code></pre>

<p>Oho, so much work has been done, but we have not seen anything interesting happen,
where is my history:</p>

<p>Now there is the thing called <code>git log</code>, which is one of the many ways to get
a look at the history:</p>

<pre><code>peter@vostro:~/mydir$ git log

commit 3ccdf5e1ab80ee2e818433ceeb9f2e01c0074f81
Author: peter &lt;peter@vostro.(none)&gt;
Date:   Wed Mar 9 09:29:13 2011 +0800

    my second verion

commit b50d0f74cec015c74c63c42d1f80236ce775a79d
Author: peter &lt;peter@vostro.(none)&gt;
Date:   Wed Mar 9 09:27:27 2011 +0800

    my first version
</code></pre>

<p>Never mind if you don’t quit get what all these output means, now at least you
know you have <code>README</code>, not only the latest version, but also all its revisions
are saved there(in <code>.git</code>? Right!).</p>

<p>Good questions now are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how can I check the difference between different revisions?</li>
  <li>how can I go back to certain point of the history and get the revision I
want?</li>
</ul>

<p>My answer now is you can do these things, really easily, because git was made to
do such jobs efficiently.

title: About Version Control 
—</p>

<p>What is version control, and why should you care? </p>

<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files
over time so that you can recall specific versions later. As a programmer, you
usually want to control software source code,though in reality you can do this
with nearly any type of files.</p>
